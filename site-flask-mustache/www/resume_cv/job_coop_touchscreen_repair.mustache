        <p>As a local branch of a global electronics company, the business manufactured and sold custom resistive, capacitive, and film-based touch-screens attached to computer-monitors and large flat-screen televisions.</p>
        <p>As part of my B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering degree-requirements I was a student co-op employee in the repair department. This work involved diagnosing, troubleshooting, and then repairing the hardware and software for the touch-screen devices and systems. A lot of the repairs involved verification of circuit-boards and some manual replacement of soldered elements on PCBs.</p>
        <p>With my Electrical Engineering background, I also helped support internal Quality Assurance efforts in the manfacturing group, and helped identify and document the repair-procedures for common issues. After moving facilities, I also helped support Six-Sigma Organization and Workflow efforts for the repair department as lead by engineering staff.</p>

        <h5 style="text-align: left;">Reason(s) for Leaving</h5>
        <p>I was originally hired for a 6-month position as a co-op student-employee. After completing this 6-month role, I accepted an offer to continue into a part-time position while working on my ongoing B.Sc. and M.Sc. dual-degree program in Electrical Engineering. After another 6 months of part-time work, I declined to continue part-time work to focus on my studies as I began taking more and more graduate-level courses.</p>
