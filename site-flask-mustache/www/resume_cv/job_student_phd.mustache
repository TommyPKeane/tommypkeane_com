        <h5 style="text-align: left;">Dissertation</h5>
        <p>In April of 2015 the funding that supported my stipend (read: paid my salary while doing research) was no longer available, and I was not in a financial position to be able to continue the research full-time without a stipend. In June of 2015 I was able to get a full-time job as a Software Engineering for SATCOM system-integration. I attempted to continue working on my dissertation on nights and weekends while working full-time as a Software Engineer on weekdays.</p>
        <p>Before April of 2015, I was able to create an early-stage prototype of the software that I thought was needed to complete the research, but it was written in Python based-on the Qt user-interface package <tt>pyside</tt>, and it wasn't able to efficiently handle video encoding/decoding and all the interactivity and scene rendering. So I was in the process of a rewrite in C and C++, while trying to switch to D and use GTK (gtkd) instead of Qt.</p>
        <p>Initially, I was not as skilled in application building/deployment and this hindered my progress. The research also required some novel image-registration requirements due to the various resolutions and qualities of the video and image data, and due to the fact that all of the imagery was set outdoors in unconstrained lighting conditions. This required extensive research in trying to integrate Information Theory and Geometric Algebra for Projective Camera Modelling.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, there were too many simultaneous research avenues that I was trying to follow-through on, and by February of 2018 I realised it would not be possible for me to complete the research, get results, and finalise a defensible dissertation before the April 15, 2018 deadline for the Ph.D. program (there was a 7-year time-limit for dissertations). I was not financially able to take 2-3 months off from my full-time job to dedicate to finalising the dissertation R&D, and working on both simultaneously was not something I felt I could keep doing.</p>
        <p>So I resigned from the program in February of 2018 with my dissertation unfinished.</p>
        <p>In April of 2020 I was furloughed and then accepted a separation agreement from my Data Scientist (Full-Stack Software Engineer) job at a Boston area startup, during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. During this unemployment period I have been working on going back over my dissertation research, updating the software (now with 5+ more years of experience), and re-documenting the mathematical relationships. I am in the process of publishing this updated research (personally and unaffiliated) on this website.</p>
