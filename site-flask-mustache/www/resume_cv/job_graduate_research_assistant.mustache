        <h5 style="text-align: left;">Research Project</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>In September of 2011, I joined the RIT-UofR joint research project for Mobile Eye-Tracking: <a href="">An Active Vision Approach to Understanding and Improving Visual Training in the Geosciences</a> -- project details can be seen at the linked external site.</li>
          <li>Originally, I was in an independent research role investigating the feasibility of automated or semi-automated 3D scene reconstruction to integrate the Mobile Eye-Traacking data that was being captured in yearly Geoscience field-trips to California.</li>
          <li>I participated in 2 of the field-trips and took on a major role in the data-wrangling as part of the multi-modal statistical analyses and 3D scene-reconstruction.</li>
          <li>I developed several software utilities in progress towards feature and region-of-interest labelling of the video and image data.</li>
          <li>I also produced a small handful of conference publications and presentations (see my Ph.D. Student role details).</li>
          <li>I also developed and clarified nomenclature relating to interdisciplinary publications around Recurrence Analysis and Recurrence Quantification Analysis in a couple of those publications.</li>
          <li>I was not able to publish anything during my Research Assistanceship, but I also was developing a Geometric Algebra representation of multi-camera Projective Algebra and Image Transformations using blades (instead of tensors), specifically for Eye-Tracking data.</li>

        <h5 style="text-align: left;">Reason(s) for Leaving</h5>
        <p>I was funded for an R&D role in a large-scale, multi-disciplinary Research Grant given to RIT and the University of Rochester. This provided my stipend (research-funding) as a Ph.D. Student (and then Candidate) through to April 2015.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, continued funding was no longer available at that point, so I sought-out and accepted a full-time position as a Software Engineer for VSAT Systems Integration in June of 2015.</p>
        <p>I continued on nights and weekends, doing research for my Ph.D. candidacy, while working full-time as a Software Engineer for SATCOM system integration.</p>
        <p>In February 2018, I conceded that I was unable to complete the dissertation requirements within the 7-year program limits, so I withdrew my Ph.D. Candidacy and left the doctoral program. I had not finished my dissertation at that time, but I had 8 years of independent R&D and Data Science experience, along with some teaching and mentorship.</p>
