I've worked in VSAT systems integration and worked with Satellite <abbr title="MODulation-DEModulation Device">MODEM</abbr>s and Energy Detection devices, so this page has a few articles of topics I've found to be interesting or worth storing for reference.

All content on this page is original, unless noted otherwise, and does not expose any proprietary or trade-secret information. I have not ever held any Classified or Top Secret role at any organization, so I can't possibly talk about what I've never known. All information here is found or deducible from public websites and Wikipedia.
