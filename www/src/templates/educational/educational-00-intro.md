Hiya!

This page provides links to educational articles and collections of educational documents that tommy has created. Everything here is free to use for personal or professional education purposes, but there's no guarantees on any of it. References are provided as often as possible, and definitely check them, as I'm bound to make some mistakes.

Logos used on this page are from the [TommyLogos](https://github.com/TommyPKeane/tommy_logos) project on GitHub, a collection of free-to-use custom Logos.
