            <p>this is the personal website of a certain <b>tommy p. keane</b>.</p>
            <p>if that illustration over there doesn't look like the vegan, Ph.D. dropout, myopic, Scientific Engineer (born in the USA during the 1980s) that you're lookin' for, then you might've stumbled across the wrong {{{tommy}}}. thanks for visiting, though!</p>
            <p>but, if this all sounds like the <b>tommy p. keane</b> that you were expecting, then, welcome!, again! this is basically the only site that {{{tommy}}} maintains on the internet(s), so whatever you're lookin' for is probably around here somewhere.</p>
            <p>if you'd like to change the site theme, you can use the <span class="text-svg">{{{icon_settings}}}</span>(Settings) button to configure the site cookies. otherwise, this is a cookie-less and tracker-less site.</p>

            <p>Or, if you're just curious about software development, the documentation and code is usually pretty verbose, and might (hopefully) be a useful resource. ðŸ˜„</p>

            <p>After being being furloughed due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">SARS-CoV-2 Pandemic</a>, {{{tommy}}} accepted a "Separation Agreement" and was unemployed from April through August 2020 -- taking the time to career search, continue developing DevOps and Software Engineering skills, and finally starting (and organising) the projects you now see on this updated site.</p>
            <p>for the sake of anonymity and to encourage a personal-professional disconnect, the names of <b>tommy's</b> current and previous employers have been redacted from this site, but you can look through the <a href="/resume/">Business (CV)</a> page(s) to learn about <b>tommy's</b> work history and relevant technology skills.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="billet-body">
            <p>{{{tommy}}} is a native speaker of American English, and it's the only language {{{tommy}}} is actually fluent in. one thing to watch out for, though, is that {{{tommy}}} tends to use British English spellings (double L, S instead of Z, extra U, and all that) with maximum effort and occluded reasoning. there's also a bit of a Bostonian influence, so {{{tommy}}} may do an <i>ah</i> instead of a <i>u</i>, or probably add an <i>r</i> to make things <span class="hoverable" aria-describedby="hv-sawr-example">easier to pronounce</span>. oh, not really a warning; but there is, of course, an accurately abundant use of commas. and as some thievery from academic writing, most of this site is written in the third-person plural (<i>we, us, our, ...</i>), even though it's just me, here, alone, again, naturally.</p>
            <p>{{{tommy}}} tries to use they/them in any creative, explanatory, scientific, or professional writing; so as to be neutral and inclusive. {{{tommy}}} will legitimately be happy to be referred to by any pronouns you wanna use -- most likely order of preference: they / he / she. {{{tommy}}} doesn't have anything &ldquo;figured out&rdquo;, {{{tommy}}}'s a pacifistic vegan, and probably a paranoid solipsist just tryin' to remain anonymous.</p>
