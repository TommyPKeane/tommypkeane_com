# Manjaro ARM Phosh Operating-System

In August 2020, we downloaded the Alpha2 release of Manjaro ARM running the Phosh desktop environment, and successfully booted-it on our UBports Community Edition Pine64 PinePhone.

This page covers the process of how to download and run the operating system, how to configure it, and some of its notable features.

Since the phone was built to natively run the UBports Ubuntu-Touch operating system, a second OS can be run from the MicroSD slot under the back-cover of the phone. This way, if the secondary OS fails, the phone should be able to always reboot back into the Ubuntu-Touch OS, so as not to "brick" the phone.

As such, this is a pretty painless process and encourages lot of experimentation.
